## Anomaly-Detection-Project
**Goal**

  Analyze the curriculum access logs and answer the questions posed by the leaders.
  
**Phases**

  - Plan
  - Acquire
  - Prepare
  - Explore
  - Answer questions

**Questions that needed answers**
  
 1. Which lesson appears to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)?
 2. Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more that other cohorts seemed to gloss over? 
 3. Are there students who, when active, hardly access the curriculum? If so, what information do you have about these students? 
 4. Is there any suspicious activity, such as users/machines/etc accessing the curriculum who shouldnâ€™t be? Does it appear that any web-scraping is happening? Are there any suspicious IP addresses? Any odd user-agents? 
 5. At some point in the last year, ability for students and alumni to cross-access curriculum (web dev to ds, ds to web dev) should have been shut off. Do you see any evidence of that happening? Did it happen before? 
 6. What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)? 
 7. Which lessons are least accessed? 
 8. Anything else I should be aware of? 
 
 **Deliverables**
